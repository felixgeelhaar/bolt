# Bolt Logging Library - Production SLA/SLI Framework

## Executive Summary

This document defines Service Level Agreements (SLAs), Service Level Indicators (SLIs), and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for the Bolt logging library in production environments. These metrics ensure industry-leading performance while maintaining operational excellence.

## Service Level Indicators (SLIs)

### Core Performance Metrics

#### 1. Logging Latency
- **Definition**: Time taken to complete a logging operation from API call to persistence
- **Measurement**: 95th percentile of `bolt_logging_duration_seconds` metric
- **Target**: < 100Œºs (0.0001 seconds)
- **Rationale**: Sub-100Œºs latency ensures minimal application impact

```prometheus
# SLI Query
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(bolt_logging_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
```

#### 2. Zero-Allocation Compliance
- **Definition**: Memory allocations per logging operation
- **Measurement**: `bolt_allocation_count_total` increments
- **Target**: 0 allocations per operation
- **Rationale**: Zero-allocation guarantee maintains predictable memory usage

```prometheus
# SLI Query
rate(bolt_allocation_count_total[5m]) / rate(bolt_log_events_total[5m])
```

#### 3. Throughput Capacity
- **Definition**: Maximum sustainable logging operations per second
- **Measurement**: Rate of `bolt_log_events_total`
- **Target**: > 1,000,000 operations/second
- **Rationale**: High-throughput capability for demanding applications

```prometheus
# SLI Query
rate(bolt_log_events_total[1m])
```

#### 4. Error Rate
- **Definition**: Percentage of logging operations that fail
- **Measurement**: Ratio of errors to total operations
- **Target**: < 0.1% (99.9% success rate)
- **Rationale**: High reliability for critical logging operations

```prometheus
# SLI Query
rate(bolt_logging_errors_total[5m]) / rate(bolt_log_events_total[5m])
```

### System Health Metrics

#### 5. Service Availability
- **Definition**: Percentage of time the logging service is operational
- **Measurement**: Uptime monitoring via health checks
- **Target**: 99.99% (52.6 minutes downtime/year)
- **Rationale**: Mission-critical logging requires extreme reliability

```prometheus
# SLI Query
avg_over_time(up{job="bolt-app"}[5m])
```

#### 6. Resource Efficiency
- **Definition**: CPU and memory utilization under load
- **Measurement**: Resource usage metrics
- **Target**: < 50% CPU, < 1GB memory at 100k ops/sec
- **Rationale**: Efficient resource usage for cost-effective operations

```prometheus
# SLI Queries
rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{job="bolt-app"}[5m])
process_resident_memory_bytes{job="bolt-app"}
```

#### 7. Event Pool Health
- **Definition**: Available events in the object pool
- **Measurement**: `bolt_event_pool_available_events`
- **Target**: > 10% of total pool size
- **Rationale**: Adequate buffer for burst traffic handling

```prometheus
# SLI Query
(bolt_event_pool_available_events / bolt_event_pool_total_events) * 100
```

### Operational Metrics

#### 8. Configuration Compliance
- **Definition**: Adherence to security and operational policies
- **Measurement**: Configuration drift detection
- **Target**: 100% compliance with security baselines
- **Rationale**: Consistent security posture across environments

#### 9. Deployment Success Rate
- **Definition**: Successful deployments without rollback
- **Measurement**: Deployment pipeline metrics
- **Target**: > 95% success rate
- **Rationale**: Stable deployment process for continuous delivery

#### 10. Alert Response Time
- **Definition**: Time to acknowledge and respond to critical alerts
- **Measurement**: AlertManager metrics
- **Target**: < 5 minutes acknowledgment, < 15 minutes resolution
- **Rationale**: Rapid response to maintain service quality

```

#### Example: 99.99% Availability SLO
- **30-day Error Budget**: (1 - 0.9999) √ó 30 days = 4.32 minutes
- **Weekly Error Budget**: (1 - 0.9999) √ó 7 days = 1.01 minutes
- **Daily Error Budget**: (1 - 0.9999) √ó 1 day = 8.64 seconds

### Error Budget Policies

#### When Error Budget is Healthy (> 25% remaining)
- ‚úÖ Normal feature development velocity
- ‚úÖ Regular deployments allowed
- ‚úÖ Experimental features permitted
- ‚úÖ Performance optimizations encouraged

#### When Error Budget is Moderate (10-25% remaining)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased monitoring and alerting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Feature development continues with caution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-critical deployments may be delayed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Focus on reliability improvements

#### When Error Budget is Low (< 10% remaining)
- üö® Deployment freeze for non-critical features
- üö® Focus exclusively on reliability
- üö® Emergency response team activation
- üö® Executive stakeholder notification

#### When Error Budget is Exhausted (0% remaining)
